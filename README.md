## 📝 Project Write-Up — DengarInklusif

### 💡 Problem Statement
In Indonesia, more than 10,000 visually impaired students are enrolled in special needs schools (SLB). However, access to inclusive and interactive digital learning materials remains extremely limited. Most educational resources are static, hard to navigate, or not designed for independent learning—leaving these students behind in the digital age.

### 🎯 Our Solution: DengarInklusif
DengarInklusif is an inclusive, AI-powered learning platform designed specifically for visually impaired students. It transforms static educational content into engaging, audio-based experiences—complete with summaries, interactive flashcards, voice-based quizzes, and guided voice assistants.
By simply uploading a textbook or PDF, the system reads the material aloud, summarizes it, generates flashcards, and allows students to ask voice-based questions for better understanding.

### 👤 Target Audience
Visually impaired students in elementary to high school
Teachers and parents supporting students with visual impairments
Inclusive schools (SLB) across Indonesia
